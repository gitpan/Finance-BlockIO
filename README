Finance-BlockIO

This is just a WWW::Curl::Simple-based wrapper for Block.io.  It does some
sugary stuff like automatically decoding the JSON responses, but is otherwise a
direct representation of the API.

For more information on how to actually use this, see
https://block.io/api/detailed/curl.

Future enhancements may include an object-oriented interface and the ability to
pass arguments via a hash reference; neither are currently implemented.
